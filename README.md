# Employee Salary Prediction

This project predicts employee salaries based on various features like experience, education, and job roles using machine learning regression models.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate an employee's salary using historical data. This can help HR departments with planning, salary benchmarking, and offer decisions.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook with data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `random_forest_model.pkl`: The saved Random Forest model (for deployment or further use).
- `scaler.pkl`: The saved scaler object used to preprocess input data.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data analysis and processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and preprocessing
- **Joblib** – Saving and loading models

## 📊 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Comparison based on R² score and other metrics

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository : git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-salary-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the folder : cd employee-salary-prediction
3. Open the notebook : jupyter notebook Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb
4. Install required libraries (if not already installed) : pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib


## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add a web interface using Streamlit or Flask
- Include more features in the dataset (e.g., location, industry)
- Try advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks
- Deploy model using a cloud platform
